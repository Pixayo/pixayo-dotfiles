## About

This repository is a collection of Nix files meant to define and
manage my personal NixOS environment.

Something like this could (and probably should) be private. However,
I decided to make it public to share my experience using NixOS and,
hopefully, serve as a source of information for other users.

Because of that, this repository is not just a pile of obscure
configurations. Most decisions and changes are documented to some
extent, either through README files and other Markdown documents
or directly within the code itself. I plan to keep expanding this
documentation over time.
